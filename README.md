## 📌 Description

Lootbags Magnet Mod is a mod for **7 Days to Die** that automatically teleports nearby lootbags using a dedicated block.  
When this block is activated, it scans the area immediately and then every five minutes, moving any lootbags found within its range while triggering a **custom sound effect**.  
> **Note:** Once a lootbag has been teleported, it will not be teleported again until the block is deactivated and then reactivated.
